In order to use this, you'll need:
    - zsh
    - Moscow ML

Other SML interpreters might work, but that hasn't been tested.

To use this, simply write
    ./rsg.sh <grammar>
in the console, where <grammar> is the name of the grammar you wish to use.

The grammar is read from the grammars/ directory.

An example of usage is:
    > ./rsg.sh dialog
    Bamse of DIKU Dyrskue: Do you happen to know the earthworm?
    Strong Yellow Flexible Jakob: Hell naw!
    Mwahahah!
